This repository contains basic AI algorithm implementations as part of my learning journey. Currently it includes:
1. Breadth First Search (BFS) Algoritm: An implementation of the BFS algo in Python for traversing tree/graph data structure.
    * Traverses all possible nodes from the given source.
    * Prints the final traversal order.
2. Vaccum Cleaner Agent Simulation: A simple reflex agentthat simulates a vaccum cleaner operating in a two-room environment.
    * It cleans dirty rooms based on the sensor input.
    * Mimics AI decision-making using condition-action rules
